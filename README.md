# 🐍 Data Analysis with Python – freeCodeCamp Projects

Certified Data Analysis with Python projects completed via freeCodeCamp – includes five end-to-end analytical Python projects.

This repository contains my completed projects from the **[Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)** by **freeCodeCamp**. Through these hands-on projects, I revised and applied core Python concepts for data analysis and visualization using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
